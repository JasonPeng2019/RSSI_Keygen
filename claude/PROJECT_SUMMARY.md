## Code Quality

### Features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean, documented code
- Thread-safe operations
- Resource cleanup
- User-friendly interfaces
- Progress indicators
- Graceful degradation

### Programming Best Practices
- Modular design with classes
- Separation of concerns
- Configuration parameters
- Defensive programming
- Meaningful variable names
- Inline comments for complex logic

## Dependencies

### System Requirements
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Wi-Fi adapter with monitor mode support
- Root/sudo access

### Python Packages
- **scapy**: Packet crafting and sniffing
- **numpy**: Statistical calculations
- **curses**: Terminal UI (built-in)
- **threading**: Concurrent operations (built-in)
- **hashlib**: Cryptographic hashing (built-in)

### Hardware Recommendations
- USB Wi-Fi adapters with Atheros, Ralink, or Realtek chipsets
- Tested with: TP-Link TL-WN722N, Alfa AWUS036NHA

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results

**Part 1:**
- Use non-overlapping channels (1, 6, or 11)
- Start survivor first
- Move slowly and observe trends
- Use average RSSI, not instantaneous
- Test in various environments

**Part 2:**
- Place devices 0.5 meters apart
- Wave hand vigorously
- Continue waving throughout exchange
- Vary hand motion patterns
- Avoid blocking both antennas

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No packets captured**: Verify monitor mode with `iwconfig`
2. **Permission denied**: Always use `sudo`
3. **No interface found**: Check interface name with `iw dev`
4. **Key exchange fails**: Increase hand motion, adjust z parameter
5. **Low RSSI**: Move devices closer, reduce obstacles

## Educational Value

This lab teaches:
- **Wireless Protocols**: 802.11 frame structure, monitor mode

- **Signal Processing**: Statistical analysis of wireless signals
- **System Programming**: Multi-threaded applications, real-time UIs
